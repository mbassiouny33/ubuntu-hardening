# ubuntu-hardening
a set of commands for ubuntu hardening


I once worked on a project that required hardening for their machines.
Some machines just need to be secure but quiet usable, while some others had senstive information that we could simply prefer to sacrifice root access and repair mechanisms for the OS for the cost of security.

For normal usage you can safely use the `hardening-moderate.sh` script. Just download it and make it executable

`chmod +x hardening-moderate.sh
./hardening-moderate.sh`
